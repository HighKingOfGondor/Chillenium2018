soooo....Here's the deal:


There are like 3 directories of Chillenium2018

~/Chillenium2018

~/Chillenium2018/Chillenium2018

and ~/Chillenium2018/Chillenium2018/Chillenium2018

And each one has a .project file inside of it

We are agreeing to use the TOP most direcotry. the one called ~/Chillenium2018

We are ignoring the /Chillenium2018 directories below this top one.


Thanks and Gig 'em.
